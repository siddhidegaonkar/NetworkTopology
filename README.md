# NetworkTopology


In this Project we have implemented Network Topology Characteristics in Java. Each complex network (or class of networks) 
presents specific topological features which characterize its connectivity and highly influence the dynamics of processes 
executed on the network. The analysis, discrimination, and synthesis of complex networks therefore rely on the use of 
measurements capable of expressing the most relevant topological features.
